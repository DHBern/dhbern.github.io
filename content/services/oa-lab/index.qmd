The *Open Access Lab (OA Lab)* supports researchers in publishing scientific work in open access (Diamond OA). Our goal is to promote innovative, publisher-independent publication formats that integrate both text and multimedia elements.

## Our services include

-   Consulting on the establishment and further development of academic OA journals
-   Support in the development of innovative publication formats (e.g. linking text, images, audio and video files)
-   Support in submitting OA journals to metrics-based indices (DOAJ, SCOPUS, Web of Science)
-   Image management and legal advice on image rights
