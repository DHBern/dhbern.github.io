*nodegoat Go* is a virtual research environment for modelling, visualising, and analysing heterogeneous data.¹ Researchers and students at the University of Bern can apply for **free, institution-hosted domains** and carry out projects in the humanities, social, and natural sciences.²

-   **Currently active projects:** 113\
-   **Researchers on the platform:** 186

## Services

-   Provision of a personal or group research environment\
-   Support with data entry, visualisation, and network analysis\
-   Organisation of workshops and training on nodegoat (introductory & advanced)\
-   **Application support:** help in drafting data models and setting up collaborative workflows

## How to apply for a domain/account

The Faculty of Humanities maintains a licensed installation of nodegoat Go. **Students and staff can request a personal or project domain via this [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegTg4-Mu5pUzayOex_lo_Mh_7xETy73trENKgMNnSoCp0U1g/viewform); accounts are created manually and become active within two working days.**³

## Typical use cases

-   **Prosopography & social-network research** – tracing persons, events, and relationships over time to reveal hidden communities or migration patterns.\
-   **Digital editions & textual projects** – storing TEI/XML or metadata alongside facsimiles and linking passages to people, places, or concepts.\
-   **Spatial history & historical GIS** – mapping artifact distributions, travel routes, or settlement patterns with time filters.\
-   **Archaeological typologies** – classifying objects and running similarity or network analyses to test cultural hypotheses.\
-   **Data-publication pipelines** – exporting curated datasets as JSON/CSV and exposing an API or interactive viewer for the public.⁴

These scenarios leverage nodegoat’s built-in data modelling, temporal–spatial visualisation, and network-analysis tools⁵ as demonstrated in UniBE projects such as *Forced Academic Migration*, *Reading the Beach*, and *RAG Online*.⁶
