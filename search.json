You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\nNo endorsement.

For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\nIf You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter’s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE.

WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

On the client we have familiar looking OJS inputs and a plot laid out using panel: sidebar and panel: fill:\n```{ojs}\n//| panel: sidebar\nvars = [\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\", \"Petal.Length\", \"Petal.Width\"]\nviewof xcol = Inputs.select(vars, {label: \"X Variable\"})\nviewof ycol = Inputs.select(vars, {label: \"Y Variable\", value: vars[1]})\nviewof count = Inputs.range([1, 9], {label: \"Cluster Count\", step: 1, value: 3})\n```\n\n```{ojs}\n//| panel: fill\nPlot.plot({\n  color: {\n    type: \"ordinal\",\n    scheme: \"category10\"\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.dot(transpose(selectedData), {\n      x: xcol,\n      y: ycol,\n      fill: (d, i) =&gt; clusters.cluster[i],\n    }),\n    Plot.dot(clusters.centers, { \n      x: d =&gt; d[0],\n      y: d =&gt; d[1],\n      r: 10,\n      stroke: \"black\",\n      fill: (d, i) =&gt; i + 1\n    }),\n  ]\n})\n```\nNote that the plotting code references the variables selectedData and clusters. These will be provided by reactive expressions within the Shiny server code. Note also that we use the transpose() function to reshape the data into the row-oriented format that the Plot library expects.\nHere is the server code:\n```{r}\n#| context: server\n\nselectedData &lt;- reactive({\n  iris[, c(input$xcol, input$ycol)]\n})\n\nclusters &lt;- reactive({\n  kmeans(selectedData(), input$count)\n})\n\nojs_define(selectedData, clusters)\n```\nWe designate this code as running on the server via the context: server option.\nNote that we reference several inputs that were defined by viewof expressions on the client (e.g. input$xcol). When these inputs change they will cause the appropriate server side reactives to re-execute.\nWe create two reactive values (selectedData and clusters) and provide them to the client using ojs_define(). The plot will be automatically re-drawn on the client side when these values change."

This provides a reasonable separation of concerns, and prevents excess network traffic in the case that you have large OJS variables.\nHowever, if you want to use other OJS variables as Shiny inputs this is also possible using the ojs-export option. The default behavior maps to the following configuration:\n---\nserver:\n  type: shiny\n  ojs-export: viewof\n---\nYou can also specify ojs-export: all to cause all OJS reactives to be bound to Shiny inputs:\n---\nserver:\n  type: shiny\n  ojs-export: all\n---\nAlternatively, you can specify a list of OJS reactives by name (including using ~ to filter out reactives), and optionally combine this with the viewof and/or all options. For example:\n---\nserver:\n  type: shiny\n  ojs-export: [all, ~large_dataset]\n---\n\n\nShiny to OJS\nLess common but occasionally useful is the ability to bind Shiny inputs into OJS. By default no such bindings occur, however you can use the ojs-import option to opt-in for specific Shiny inputs. For example:\n---\nserver: \n  type: shiny\n  ojs-import: [minimum, maximum]\n---"

    "text": "Python and R\nThe data you want to use with OJS might not always be available in raw form. Often you’ll need to read and preprocess the raw data using Python or R. You can perform this preprocessing during document render (in an {r} or {python} code cell) and then make it available to {ojs} cells via the ojs_define() function.\nHere’s an example. We’ll read the same data into R, do some grouping and summarization, then make it available to OJS using ojs_define:\n\n```{r}\n#| output: false\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nco2 = read_csv(\"co2_mm.csv\")  %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  summarize(max = max(average))\n\nojs_define(co2data = co2)\n```\n\nNote that we could have done the same thing using Python (the ojs_define function is available in any document that uses R or Python).\nNow we plot the data using Observable Plot:\n\n```{ojs}\nyearlyChart = Plot.plot({\n  marks: [\n    Plot.line(transpose(co2data), \n      {x: \"year\", y: \"max\"}, \n      { stroke: \"black\" }\n    )\n  ]}\n)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the NOAA C02 example for the full source code.\n\nTranspose\nYou’ll note one additional twist in the OJS code above: we call the transpose function on our co2data before plotting it. The transpose function is built in to Quarto’s OJS engine, and will convert column-oriented datasets (like the ones used in Python and R) into the row-oriented datasets used by many JavaScript plotting libraries (including Plot).\nFor example, the following JSON data emitted from R or Python:\n{\n  \"year\": [1958, 1959, 1960],\n  \"max\":  [317.51, 318.29, 320.04]\n}\nIs converted to the following via the call to transpose:\n[\n  { \"year\": 1959, \"max\": 317.51 },\n  { \"year\": 1960, \"max\": 318.29 },\n  { \"year\": 1960, \"max\": 320.04 }\n]\nCheck the documentation for whatever plotting library you are using from OJS to see whether a call to transpose is required."

Die automatische Erkennung und Aufbereitung von handschriftlichem Material ist seit wenigen Jahren mit guter Qualität möglich.\nDie handschriftlich verfassten Bundesratsprotokolle der Jahre 1848 bis 1903 liegen zwar als Digitalisate vor (siehe: www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch), sie sind jedoch nur schwer über handschriftliche Register und Sitzungsnummern suchbar. Im Rahmen des Projekts werden 150’000 Seiten der Bundesratsprotokolle segmentiert (p2pala und citlab advanced layout analysis) und mittels Texterkennung (Pylaia) aufbereitet. Der gesamte Prozess läuft in Transkribus und wird in eine Such- und Blätteroberfläche eingespiesen.\nDer Zugang zu den erkannten Dokumenten ist über das Bundesarchiv möglich: www.chgov.bar.admin.ch/search.\nDas Projekt befindet sich im Abschluss, siehe dazu die Medienmitteilung des Bundesarchivs vom 3.2.2022.\nDas Projekt ist eine Kooperation des Schweizerischen Bundesarchivs und der Digital Humanities.

This is more akin to a spreadsheet than a traditional notebook with linear cell execution.\nFor example, in this cell we reference a variable that is not yet defined (it’s defined immediately below):\n\n```{ojs}\nx + 5\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{ojs}\nx = 10\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code works because the Observable runtime automatically determines the correct order of execution for the cells."

    "text": "Cell Output\nBy default, OJS cells show their full source code and output within rendered documents. Depending on the type of document you are creating you might want to change this behavior either globally or for individual cells.\n\nCode Visibility\nThe echo option controls whether cells display their source code. To prevent display of code for an entire document, set the echo: false option in YAML metadata:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n---\nYou can also specify this option on a per-cell basis. For example:\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: false\ndata = FileAttachment(\"palmer-penguins.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n```\n\n\nOutput Visibility\nOJS cell output is also displayed by default. You can change this at a global or (more likely) per-cell level using the output option. For example, here we disable output for a cell:\n```{ojs}\n//| output: false\ndata\n```\nNote that cells which only carry assignments do not print their output by default. For example, this assignment won’t print anything:\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: fenced\ndummy1 = \"aHiddenAssignment\"\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to print even the results of assignments, you can specify the output: all option. For example:\n\n```{ojs}\n//| echo: fenced\n//| output: all\ndummy2 = [{key: 1, value: [1, 2, [3, 4], dummy1]}]\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you click the inspector you’ll see it expand to reveal the data as JSON.\n\n\nCode Display\nWe talked about showing and hiding source code above, but what about controlling exactly how it’s displayed?\nThere are options available for customizing the appearance of code blocks (highlighting, background, border, etc.) as well as how horizontal overflow is handled. See the article on HTML Code Blocks for all of the details.\nOne option we wanted to specifically highlight here is code folding, which enables you to collapse code but still provide an option for users to view it. This is especially handy for custom JavaScript visualizations as they often span dozens of lines of code.\nAdd the code-fold: true option to a code cell to enable code folding (you can also enable this globally). For example, click the “Code” button to show the code block (note the code-fold: true option is specified)\n\n\nCode\n```{ojs}\n//| code-fold: true\npdata = FileAttachment(\"palmer-penguins.csv\").csv({typed: true})\n\nPlot.plot({\n  facet: {\n    data: pdata,\n    x: \"sex\",\n    y: \"species\",\n    marginRight: 80\n  },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.frame(),\n    Plot.rectY(pdata, \n      Plot.binX(\n        {y: \"count\"}, \n        {x: \"body_mass_g\", thresholds: 20, fill: \"species\"}\n      )\n    ),\n    Plot.tickX(pdata, \n      Plot.groupZ(\n        {x: \"median\"}, \n        {x: \"body_mass_g\",\n         z: d =&gt; d.sex + d.species,\n         stroke: \"#333\",\n         strokeWidth: 2\n        }\n      )\n    )\n  ]\n})\n```"

    "text": "Example\nWe’ll start with a simple example based on Allison Horst’s Palmer Penguins dataset. Here we look at how penguin body mass varies across both sex and species (use the provided inputs to filter the dataset by bill length and island):\n\nfiltered = transpose(data).filter(function(penguin) {\n  return bill_length_min &lt; penguin.bill_length_mm &&\n         islands.includes(penguin.island);\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(\n  [32, 50], \n  {value: 35, step: 1, label: \"Bill length (min):\"}\n)\nviewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(\n  [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\", \"Dream\"], \n  { value: [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\"], \n    label: \"Islands:\"\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot.rectY(filtered, \n  Plot.binX(\n    {y: \"count\"}, \n    {x: \"body_mass_g\", fill: \"species\", thresholds: 20}\n  ))\n  .plot({\n    facet: {\n      data: filtered,\n      x: \"sex\",\n      y: \"species\",\n      marginRight: 80\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.frame(),\n    ]\n  }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the source code for this example. First we create an {ojs} cell that reads in some data from a CSV file using a FileAttachment:\n```{ojs}\ndata = FileAttachment(\"palmer-penguins.csv\").csv({ typed: true })\n```\nThe example above doesn’t plot all of the data but rather a filtered subset. To create our filter we’ll need some inputs, and we’ll want to be able to use the values of these inputs in our filtering function. To do this, we use the viewof keyword and with some standard Inputs:\n```{ojs}\nviewof bill_length_min = Inputs.range(\n  [32, 50], \n  {value: 35, step: 1, label: \"Bill length (min):\"}\n)\nviewof islands = Inputs.checkbox(\n  [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\", \"Dream\"], \n  { value: [\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\"], \n    label: \"Islands:\"\n  }\n)\n```\nNow we write the filtering function that will transform the data read from the CSV using the values of bill_length_min and island.\n```{ojs}\nfiltered = data.filter(function(penguin) {\n  return bill_length_min &lt; penguin.bill_length_mm &&\n         islands.includes(penguin.island);\n})\n```\nHere we see reactivity in action: we don’t need any special syntax to refer to the dynamic input values, they “just work”, and the filtering code is automatically re-run when the inputs change. This works in much the same way a spreadsheet works when you update a cell and other cells that refer to it are recalculated.\nFinally, we’ll plot the filtered data using Observable Plot (an open-source JavaScript library for quick visualization of tabular data):\n```{ojs}\nPlot.rectY(filtered, \n  Plot.binX(\n    {y: \"count\"}, \n    {x: \"body_mass_g\", fill: \"species\", thresholds: 20}\n  ))\n  .plot({\n    facet: {\n      data: filtered,\n      x: \"sex\",\n      y: \"species\",\n      marginRight: 80\n    },\n    marks: [\n      Plot.frame(),\n    ]\n  }\n)\n```\nNote that as with our inputs, we refer to the filtered variable with no special syntax—the plotting code will be automatically re-run whenever filtered changes (which in turn is updated whenever an input changes).\nThat covers a basic end-to-end use of OJS (see the Penguins examples for the full source code).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you take a look at the Penguins code, you’ll notice something curious: the inputs and plotting code are defined before the data processing code. This demonstrates a critical difference between OJS cell execution and traditional notebooks: cells do not need to be defined in any particular order.\nBecause execution is fully reactive, the runtime will automatically execute cells in the correct order based on how they reference each other. This is more akin to a spreadsheet than a traditional notebook with linear cell execution.",

File attachments support many formats including CSV, TSV, JSON, Arrow (uncompressed), and SQLite so are a convenient way to read a dataset that has already been prepared for analysis.\nFrequently though you’ll need to do some pre-processing of your data in Python or R before it’s ready for visualization. Within Quarto, you can do this pre-processing during document render then make the results available to OJS.\nUse the ojs_define() function from Python or R to define variables that you want to use within JavaScript. For example, to reproduce the simple CSV read in Python you might do this:\n\n```{python}\nimport pandas as pd\npenguins = pd.read_csv(\"palmer-penguins.csv\")\nojs_define(data = penguins)\n```\n\n\n\n\nThe call to ojs_define(data = penguins) says that we want to make a variable named data (with the value of the penguins data frame) available to OJS\nDepending on the visualization library you use, one additional step may be required to consume the data from JavaScript. In this case, the Plot function expects data by row rather than by column, so we transpose() it before filtering:\n```{ojs}\nfiltered = transpose(data).filter(function(penguin) {\n  return bill_length_min &lt; penguin.bill_length_mm &&\n         islands.includes(penguin.island);\n})\n```\nSee the article on Data Sources to learn more about the various ways to prepare and read data.",

    "text": "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 3, 19 November 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n                        Preamble\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nDevelopers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nA secondary benefit of defending all users’ freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.\nAn older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nDefinitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others’ Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nRemote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\nby the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a “Source” link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\n\n\n\n Back to topReuseCC BY-SA 4.0"
