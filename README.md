## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository follows the [Advanced Structure for Data Analysis](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-advanced.html) of _The Turing Way_ and is organized as follows:

- `.github/` - Contains the GitHub configuration files, including the issue templates and workflows.
- `.husky/` - Contains the Husky configuration files, including the pre-commit hooks and the Husky settings.
- `.venv/` - Contains the Python virtual environment used to build the website, including the Python packages and their versions.
- `assets/` - Contains all the assets used in the website, including images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.
- `content/` - Contains the content of the website, including the main page and any additional pages.
- `renv/` - Contains the R environment used to build the website, including the R packages and their versions.

## üìÅ Content Structure and Categorization

The website is maintained under two main domains:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[https://dhbern.github.io/] --> A1[News (Blog)]
  A --> A2[Events]
  A --> A3[Projects]
  A --> A4[Services]

  B[https://www.dh.unibe.ch/] --> B1[Studies]
  B --> B2[Team]
```

- Content published at **[https://dhbern.github.io/](https://dhbern.github.io/)** includes:

  - üì∞ News and blog posts
  - üìÖ Events
  - üß™ Projects
  - üõ† Services

- The official DH Bern university pages at **[https://www.dh.unibe.ch/](https://www.dh.unibe.ch/)** cover:

  - üìö Study programs
  - üë• Team information

### Folder structure of content

```mermaid
graph TD
  root(content/)

  sub1[projects/] --> pj1[project-shortname/]
  pj1 --> pjindex[index.qmd]
  pj1 --> pjpost[YYYYMMDD-shortname-post/index.qmd]
  pj1 --> pjevent[YYYYMMDD-shortname-event/index.qmd]

  sub2[services/] --> sv1[service-shortname/]
  sv1 --> svindex[index.qmd]
    sv1 --> svpost[YYYYMMDD-shortname-post/index.qmd]
  sv1 --> svevent[YYYYMMDD-shortname-event/index.qmd]

  sub3[posts/] --> pst1[YYYYMMDD-shortname/]
  pst1 --> pstindex[index.qmd]

  sub4[events/] --> ev1[YYYYMMDD-shortname/]
  ev1 --> evindex[index.qmd]

  root --> sub1
  root --> sub2
  root --> sub3
  root --> sub4
```

- `content/projects/project-shortname/index.qmd`
  Each project resides in its own folder and can include blog posts or event entries.

- `content/services/service-shortname/index.qmd`
  Services are structured similarly but **must include** a YAML header with `categories: [services]`.

- `content/posts/YYYYMMDD-shortname/index.qmd`
  News/blog posts live here or may be embedded under a project folder. Each must include `categories: [Post]`.

- `content/events/YYYYMMDD-shortname/index.qmd`
  Events may also be project-specific or standalone and must include `categories: [Event]`.

### Categorization logic

- üè∑ News are markdown files with a YAML header containing `categories: [Post]`.
- üìÜ Events require `categories: [Event]`.
- üõ† Services require `categories: [services]`.

All such files must be named `index.qmd` inside appropriately named folders.

## Getting Started

We recommend using **GitHub Codespaces** for the easiest and fastest setup. It gives you a pre-configured, cloud-based development environment with everything ready to go ‚Äî directly in your browser.

### üöÄ Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account (if needed).

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/img_fork.png" alt="Fork the repository" style="width: 540px; margin: 1em 0;" />
</div>

2. Click the green **`<> Code`** button at the top right of this repository.

3. Select the **‚ÄúCodespaces‚Äù** tab and click **‚ÄúCreate codespace on `main`‚Äù**.

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/img_codespace.png" alt="Create Codespace" style="width: 540px; margin: 1em 0;" />
</div>

4. GitHub will now build a container that includes:

   - ‚úÖ Node.js (via `npm`)
   - ‚úÖ Python with `uv`
   - ‚úÖ R with `renv`
   - ‚úÖ Quarto

5. Once the Codespace is ready, you can preview the documentation locally inside the Codespace with:

   - **Open a terminal** in the Codespace (Terminal > New Terminal).
   - **Run the following command** to install all dependencies:

```bash
uv run quarto preview
```

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/img_terminal.png" alt="Terminal" style="width: 540px; margin: 1em 0;" />
</div>

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed locally:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and Rtools (on Windows)
- [uv (Python manager)](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

> _Note: `uv` automatically manages a Python version if none is installed._

### Local setup steps

```bash
# 1. Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# 2. Setup Python environment
uv sync

# 3. Setup R environment
Rscript -e 'install.packages("renv"); renv::restore()'

# 4. Preview documentation
uv run quarto preview
```

</details>

## Use

```bash
npm run check
```

Format all files.

```bash
npm run format
```

Run the wizard to write meaningful commit messages.

```bash
npm run commit
```

Run the wizard to create a CHANGELOG.md.

```bash

```

Preview the documentation.

```bash
uv run quarto preview
```
